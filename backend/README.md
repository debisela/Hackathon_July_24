EasyCart
EasyCart is a web application designed to help users manage and organize their grocery shopping lists. It allows users to input items, categorize them, and track their shopping progress. The app identifies items, categorizes them, and provides options to mark items as found or not found.

Features
Submit Grocery List: Input items using a text area with support for various separators (e.g., commas, periods, line breaks).
Categorize Items: Items are grouped into categories automatically. Items with multiple matches are shown separately.
Manage Items: Mark items as "In Cart" or "Not Found." The app tracks these statuses and updates the list accordingly.
Filter View: Show only items that are "Not Found" or display all items.
Start New List: Clear the current list and start fresh with a new grocery list.
