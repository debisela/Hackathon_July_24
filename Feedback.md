Project Name: EasyCart
Team Members: Debi Sela

1. Overall Impression:
Overall, the project is well executed, and both the design and the structure are good.

2. Technical Implementation:
The project has good use of node.js and SQL. Very efficient JS implementation.

3. User Experience:
The UX and the design of the project looks great and fits the project well.

4. Strengths:
The project is very well put together and is very compact.

5. Areas for Improvement:
The multiple matches section will become more problematic the more things are added to the database. This can make the UX very difficult  to use. To fix this, we can change the matching to be exact by removing the "ILIKE" in the model and adding a no match section at the end. but will only be a problem if you keep updating the database with new things.

6. Final Thoughts:
Very good project. Look into React Native in the future, the project will work very well as a mobile app.
